# Sorting Algorithm

Sorting algorithm used to sort strings, numbers, and linked lists written in  TypeScript

## Installation

Use the package manager [node](https://www.npmjs.com/) to run the algorithm.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
index.ts is where the sorting data is.

```python
[nodemon] starting `node build/index.js`
[start:run] [ -3, 0, 55, 88, 100, 470 ]
[start:run] AbbcCEeHJLlMSuv
[start:run] -654
[start:run] 0
[start:run] 53
[start:run] 1000
[start:run] 7777
```

## What I Learned


```
* Classes and interfaces working together
* Implementing a linked list with bubble sort
* Code refactoring
* Extending in classes
* The 'get' keyword
```
